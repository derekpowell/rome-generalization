The Cleveland Cavaliers star has a reputation for being a villain for the sake of villainy. He’s been accused of “hating” the city where he grew up in Akron and the city that raised him — Cleveland — as if that', \"The greatest strength of LeBron James is his versatility. He can score, rebound, defend, pass, run the floor, create for others, and do just about everything that an NBA player is expected to do. But he can also do things no other player can. James is a one-man offense. When the game is on the line, there are few players who can make as many plays in a game as LeBron. He's the best at it, too,\", 'LeBron James is widely regarded as one of the best basketball players of all time, with a resume filled with championships, records, and accolades that would be the envy of any athlete. He is also the face of the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise and the most popular athlete in the world with a massive social media following. But the most popular athlete in the world has a lot of competition. The most followed person in America is President Donald Trump and his nearly 40 million Twitter followers. Trump', 'LeBron James is known for his unstoppable force, but his force is also unstoppable. It’s the force of the universe. It is the force that has brought the world to James’ feet, the force that has given him the ability to be a basketball superstar. It is the force that has made him the most popular basketball player in the world. It is the force that makes him a global brand. It is the force that will keep James in Cleveland. And', \"My favorite part of LeBron James' game is the way he plays defense. He plays it as though he's a point guard, not a forward or a center. He's the best defensive center in the game, but he doesn't play like one. I've seen him block shots, steal rebounds, block shots from guards, and he always seems to make the play that wins the game, whether he's guarding the opposing team's star, the opposing team's best scorer, or the opposing team\", 'LeBron James excels at everything he does on and off the court. But the one thing he can’t seem to get right is his hair. James’ hair is so bad that even the most hardcore LeBron fans are starting to wonder if the Cleveland Cavaliers star is a closeted gay man who’s hiding his identity by covering up with a thick head of hair. “I’m a straight man,” James told the Cleveland Plain Dealer']\n",
